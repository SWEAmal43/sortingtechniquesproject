# Sorting Techniques Project

This project is a simple Java console application that demonstrates sorting algorithms.

## Description
The program allows the user to input an array of integers, and it applies sorting techniques to sort and display the result.

## Features
- Bubble Sort: The basic sorting method with swap count enhancement.
- Selection Sort: Added as a new sorting algorithm in a separate branch.
- Merge conflict created and resolved manually during the feature integration.

## Branches
- `main`: Contains the final version of the code.
- `feature/selection-sort`: Added selection sort algorithm.
- `feature/improve-bubble-sort`: Improved bubble sort by counting swaps.

## Tags
- `v1.0`: Initial release with selection sort.
- `v1.1`: Bubble sort enhancement and conflict resolution.

## How to Run
1. Compile and run `Main.java`.
2. Enter the array size and the elements when prompted.
3. View the sorted results printed to the console.
